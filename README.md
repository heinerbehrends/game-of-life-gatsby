# Game-of-life-gatsby

Game-of-life-gatsby is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970.

This project was bootstrapped with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world).

The UI is implemented using the React library. State management is done using the Redux package. The application uses the immer library to update the immutable application state.
